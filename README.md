The way you play the game is by clicking the targets as they appear on screen. Some targets are friendly and will give you a game over if shot. Use your mouse to point and click the target. The time limit will be 1 minute. The score will keep track of how many targets you hit.


In this game players will be able to:
    Aim at targets with the mouse
    Click target which will make the disappear
    Watch there score go up as the click targets

In addition, this project will include:
    The Canvas API for the targets to render
    Webpack to bundle and transpile the source JavaScript code
    Npm to manage project dependencies
